# SSH

SSH stands for Secure SHell, and it not a shell at all. Go figure.

SSH creates a secure connection over an IP network using TCP. This connection is encrypted, and generic. While the typical uses include running a shell remotely, access or transferring files (sftp/sshfs), and redirecting TCP port (ex: for an X11 application), ssh is a general purpose TCP port encryption tool.
